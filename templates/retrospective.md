# Retrospective

*Instructions: A blameless, lightweight document to fill out after a launch or major milestone. Focus on what you will change next time.*

## 1. What We Set Out To Do
[Briefly restate the original goal. E.g., "Build an automated onboarding email sequence to improve activation by 15%."]

## 2. What Actually Shipped
[The reality. E.g., "We shipped a 3-email sequence, but had to cut the personalisation feature because the API integration was too flaky."]

## 3. What Worked
[Focus on specific processes or technical choices. E.g., "Using the 'Prototyping' skill for the agent allowed us to mock up the email templates in 2 hours instead of 2 days."]

## 4. What Didn't Work
[Be specific and objective. E.g., "We didn't define edge cases early enough. We accidentally emailed 50 existing customers the 'Welcome' email because our database query was wrong."]

## 5. What We'd Do Differently
[Tactical changes. E.g., "Next time, we will run the query on a staging database and manually review the recipient list before tying it to the email sender."]

## 6. What We Learned About Our Users
[E.g., "Users don't read emails sent on Fridays. Open rates were 4% vs 45% on Tuesdays."]

## 7. What We Learned About Our Process
[E.g., "Writing a solid `project-context.md` file saved us hours of arguing over scope. We need to do that for every feature."]

## 8. One Thing to Change Next Time
[The single commitment to take into the next sprint. E.g., "We will implement feature flags for all new outward-facing communication."]

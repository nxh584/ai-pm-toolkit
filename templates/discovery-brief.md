# Discovery Brief

*Instructions: Use this document to plan user research before you conduct it, ensuring you aren't just seeking validation for an idea you already have.*

## 1. What We Think the Problem Is
[State your current hypothesis. E.g., "We hypothesise that mid-market HR managers struggle to track employee hardware returns after offboarding, leading to thousands of dollars in lost laptops."]

## 2. What We Don't Know Yet
[The gaps in your knowledge. E.g., "We don't know *where* the process breaks down. Is it that exiting employees ignore the shipping label? Or is HR forgetting to track who has what?"]

## 3. Who We Need to Talk To
[Specific profiles. E.g., "5 HR managers at companies with 100-500 employees. They must be the person physically responsible for laptops."]

## 4. What We're Trying to Learn
[Focus on learning, not validating. E.g., "We want to learn the exact physical steps they take on an employee's last day, and what specific spreadsheet or tool they are looking at while doing it."]

## 5. How We'll Know We've Learned Enough
[When do we stop researching? E.g., "When we can accurately map the offboarding workflow of 4 different companies without hearing any major new surprises."]

## 6. What We'll Do With What We Find
[The next step. E.g., "If the problem is severe, we will spin up a 2-day prototype of an automated Slack reminder bot to test with these same 5 participants next week."]

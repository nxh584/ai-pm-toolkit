# AI PM Toolkit

The `ai-pm-toolkit` is a comprehensive, production-ready GitHub repository designed for solo PMs, startup PMs, and aspiring PMs learning AI-native workflows. The modern PM's bottleneck is no longer implementation, but knowing what to build and being able to articulate it clearly enough for agents to act on. This toolkit provides the essential resources to master the core skills of the AI-era PM: problem shaping, context curation, and evaluation and taste, empowering you to effectively collaborate with AI agents and ship better products.

## Philosophy

You do not need to adopt everything here to get value out of this toolkit. Our approach is fundamentally modular—grab exactly what you need for the problem at hand and leave the rest. Whether you're looking to refine how you shape a problem, need a better context document to ground your AI agent, or want a structured workflow for going from discovery to an actionable spec, you can integrate these pieces into your existing process. The goal is to augment your PM skills, not to force you into a rigid new framework.

## Start Here

Depending on what you want to achieve today, jump into the right section:

- **"I want to build something today"** → Check out the [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) and the [zero-to-prototype workflow](workflows/zero-to-prototype.md).
- **"I use Cursor, Claude Code, or Windsurf"** → Head to the [ide-setup/](ide-setup/) directory to grab the right configuration file for your environment.
- **"I want templates for my PM docs"** → Browse the [templates/](templates/) directory for lightweight, AI-era formats.

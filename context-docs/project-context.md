# Project Context: [Project Name]

*Instructions: Use this file as the working memory for a specific feature or initiative. It bounds the scope so the agent doesn't build the whole world.*

## 1. The Problem We're Solving
[Link to your `problem-statement.md` or summarise the core pain point here in 1-2 sentences. e.g., "Support leads have no way to quickly see if a bug is affecting 1 user or 1,000 without manually compiling Jira tickets."]

## 2. What We're NOT Solving (Out of Scope)
[Explicitly list what the agent should NOT build. e.g., "We are NOT building a new ticketing system. We are NOT building AI auto-responses. We are ONLY building the aggregation layer."]

## 3. What Good Looks Like
[Provide references, examples, or benchmarks. e.g., "It should feel as frictionless as Linear's command menu. The data density should match Stripe's dashboard."]

## 4. What We've Tried in This Project So Far
[Log your iterations here. e.g., "V1 tried to use vector search across all tickets, but it was too slow and costly. We are pivoting to simple keyword counting for this next pass."]

## 5. Open Questions
[List decisions that haven't been made yet. e.g., "Should we update the counts in real-time via websockets, or is a 5-minute cron job sufficient? (Agent, flag this for discussion before building)."]

## 6. Success Criteria
[How will we know this project actually succeeded? Concrete metrics. e.g., "The support lead can generate a top-10 bug list in under 60 seconds. Currently it takes them 45 minutes."]

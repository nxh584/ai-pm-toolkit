# User Context Template

*Instructions: Replace the bracketed text with reality. Do not invent details. Base this entirely on actual conversations, tickets, and behavioural data.*

## 1. Who They Are (Specifics)
[Describe the user based on reality, not archetypes. e.g., "Non-technical founders at SaaS companies doing under $1M ARR who handle their own support tickets."]

## 2. What They're Trying to Accomplish (Direct Quotes)
[Use exact quotes from users describing their goal. e.g., "I just want to know why 30% of people drop off during the payment step without having to learn SQL."]

## 3. What Makes Them Give Up
[What specific friction points cause them to abandon the product or fallback to a spreadsheet? e.g., "If it takes more than 3 clicks to find the weekly report, they go back to asking data science on Slack."]

## 4. What Makes Them Pay Attention
[What is the moment of delight or the trigger that brings them back? e.g., "Getting an alert that a high-value account is actively engaged right now."]

## 5. Evidence (Interviews / Support / Sales)
[Paste raw data here. Actual snippets from Zendesk, Gong, or user interviews.]
- Quote 1: "..."
- Quote 2: "..."

## 6. Their Mental Model
[What do they assume the product should do? What real-world analog are they comparing you to? e.g., "They treat our CRM like an email inbox—they want to mark things read, snooze them, and hit zero."]

## 7. Success for Them
[What does a successful outcome look like for this user specifically? e.g., "Spending 10 minutes less per day copy-pasting customer names into Stripe."]

# Project Context: Q3 Feature Prioritisation

## 1. The Problem We're Solving
We have 12 highly requested features in the backlog, but we only have 1 engineer and a 2-week sprint window available before the big Q3 marketing launch. We need to decide which *one* feature to build right now to support that launch.

## 2. What We're NOT Solving (Out of Scope)
- We are not re-architecting the backend.
- We are not hiring contractors to expand capacity.
- We are not delaying the marketing launch.

## 3. Hard Constraints
- **Time/Resources**: Exactly 1 Senior Backend Engineer for 10 working days.
- **Sales Pressure**: The enterprise sales team is threatening to riot if we don't build "SSO / SAML integration" (Feature X) because a $50k deal is blocked on it.
- **Marketing Goal**: The marketing launch is focused on "Ease of Use for Solo creators."

## 4. What We've Tried in This Project So Far
- **Institutional Memory**: Last year we tried using standard RICE scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritise. It failed because everyone gamified their "Confidence" score to push their pet features, and the engineering team didn't trust the "Effort" estimates made by PMs.

## 5. What Good Looks Like
A definitive "Ship this one thing" decision, backed by a clear rationale that balances the hard constraints (1 engineer) with the strategic goal (marketing launch), while having a script ready to defend the decision against the sales team.

## 6. Success Criteria
- The chosen feature can definitively be built and tested within 10 days by 1 engineer.
- The workflow directly impacts the "Ease of Use for Solo Creators" marketing narrative.

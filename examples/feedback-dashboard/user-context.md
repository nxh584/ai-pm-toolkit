# User Context: Sarah, Solo PM

## 1. Who They Are (Specifics)
Sarah is a Solo PM at a 15-person B2B SaaS startup (HR tech for mid-market). She is non-technical, manages a backlog of 300+ items, and handles all customer discovery calls herself. 

## 2. What They're Trying to Accomplish (Direct Quotes)
"I just need a way to see what features people are asking for the most this week without having to spend three hours manually copying messages from Intercom, Notion blocks, and Slack channels into my Google Sheet."

## 3. What Makes Them Give Up
If a tool requires her to learn a new query language (like SQL or JQL), she won't use it. If it takes more than 5 minutes to set up an integration, she gives up and goes back to her spreadsheet. 

## 4. What Makes Them Pay Attention
Automation that happens invisibly in the background. Specifically, getting a digest sent directly to where she already works (Slack or Email).

## 5. Evidence (Interviews / Support / Sales)
- **Call transcript 04/12:** "My CEO asked me why we are prioritising the reporting overhaul. I *know* it's because five different customers complained about it this week, but I couldn't quickly pull the exact Intercom tickets to prove it. I felt stupid."
- **Slack message to Engineering:** "Hey, can you pull a DB query for me of everyone who hit the upgrade barrier on the dashboard? I can't figure out the Mixpanel event."

## 6. Their Mental Model
She treats qualitative feedback like an email inbox. Unprocessed feedback is "Unread." Once it's tagged and attached to a project, it's "Archived." She wants to hit Inbox Zero every Friday afternoon.

## 7. Success for Them
Spending 0 minutes copying and pasting data. Being able to answer the CEO's "Why are we building this?" question in under 30 seconds with 5 real customer quotes attached.

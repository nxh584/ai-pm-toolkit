# Workflows

Workflows are practical, step-by-step playbooks for real, focused PM work sessions. While the [Prompts](../prompts/) and [Templates](../templates/) directories contain individual tools, this directory explains how to string them together to achieve an outcome.

## Available Workflows

- **[`zero-to-prototype.md`](zero-to-prototype.md)**: A 2-hour playbook for going from a rough idea or feature request to a functional, testable prototype using AI.
- **[`discovery-to-spec.md`](discovery-to-spec.md)**: A process for turning raw user interview notes or support ticket dumps into a well-formed spec that an agent can build.
- **[`weekly-pm-routine.md`](weekly-pm-routine.md)**: An operating rhythm for AI-native Product Managers, structuring your week around planning, building, and evaluating.
- **[`ship-or-kill.md`](ship-or-kill.md)**: A rigorous decision framework for deciding what to do with a prototype once it's built to prevent accumulating technical debt.

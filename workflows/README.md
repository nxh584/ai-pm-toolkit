# Workflows

Step-by-step playbooks for common PM tasks. While the [`prompts/`](../prompts/) and [`templates/`](../templates/) directories contain individual tools, these workflows show you how to combine them in the right order to reach a specific outcome.

Use a workflow when you want structure for the full arc of a task, not just one step in it.

## How to use a workflow

Each workflow file is a self-contained guide. You can read it start-to-finish before a session to understand the full shape of the work, or keep it open alongside your agent conversation and follow it step by step as you go.

Most workflows reference specific prompts, templates, and commands from the toolkit. Everything you need is linked in the workflow file itself.

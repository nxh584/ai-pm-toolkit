# Zero to Prototype Workflow

## What this is
A structured 2-hour work session to take a loose, unstructured idea and turn it into a functional, running prototype using an AI agent. 

## When to use it
When an executive asks for a new feature, a high-value customer makes a request, or you have an idea you are convinced will solve a major pain point. Instead of arguing about it for weeks, build a sketch to learn.

## What you need before starting
- A rough idea (even a 1-sentence description).
- A blank IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, or a Claude Code terminal) positioned in a fresh directory.
- The `user-context.md` template nearby.

## Step 1: Problem Shaping (30 min)
*Do not write a line of code during this block.*
1. Paste your loose idea into the **[`prompts/problem-shaping/clarify-ambiguity.md`](../prompts/problem-shaping/clarify-ambiguity.md)** prompt. Let the agent grill you.
2. Answer the agent's questions honestly. If you don't know the constraints, stop the workflow and go find out.
3. Open the **[`templates/problem-statement.md`](../templates/problem-statement.md)** file and fill it out using the synthesis generated by the agent. Take 5 minutes to explicitly define the "What we are NOT asking for" section.

## Step 2: Context Assembly (30 min)
*Agents hallucinate without boundaries.*
1. Fill out the **[`context-docs/project-context.md`](../context-docs/project-context.md)** document.
2. Paste the problem statement into section 1.
3. Use the **[`prompts/problem-shaping/define-success.md`](../prompts/problem-shaping/define-success.md)** prompt to generate success metrics. Paste these into section 6.
4. Open your IDE and ensure the appropriate `.cursorrules` or `CLAUDE.md` is in the root directory.

## Step 3: First-Pass Build (30 min)
*Time to execute.*
1. Go to your IDE chat/terminal. Tell the agent to read the `project-context.md` file.
2. If you know you want the simplest, fastest test, use the **[`prompts/prototyping/first-pass-build.md`](../prompts/prototyping/first-pass-build.md)** prompt.
3. If you aren't sure how it should work, use the **[`prompts/prototyping/parallel-approaches.md`](../prompts/prototyping/parallel-approaches.md)** prompt instead to see options, then tell the agent to build the simplest one.
4. Wait for the agent to finish. Run the code. Play with the UI.

## Step 4: Evaluation and Iteration (15 min)
*The first version is always wrong.*
1. Play the role of the user. Try to accomplish the job. When it feels clunky or breaks, take a screenshot or copy the error.
2. Use the **[`prompts/prototyping/course-correct.md`](../prompts/prototyping/course-correct.md)** prompt. Tell the agent exactly why the UX is wrong based on your user context.
3. Run the updated code. Does it pass the minimum threshold of "works well enough to learn from"? Stop iterating.

## Step 5: Reflection (15 min)
*Document learning over code structure.*
1. Before closing the session, open **[`templates/retrospective.md`](../templates/retrospective.md)**.
2. Note what assumptions the agent made that broke the first build (this usually means your context docs were missing a hard constraint).
3. Push the code to a scratch branch. You now have a tangible artifact to discuss with engineering or show to a user tomorrow.

## What good output looks like
You end the session with a messy, ugly, but perfectly functional localised app that proves or disproves your core assumption. You spent less than 15 minutes iterating on UI layout.

## Common failure modes
- **Getting stuck in UI styling loops**: The agent gets hung up on responsive CSS when you just need to know if the API connection tests the hypothesis. Tell the agent to stop styling entirely.
- **Skipping problem shaping**: You jumped straight to the build prompt, and the agent built a massive monolithic app because you didn't define scope. Delete the code, start over at Step 1.

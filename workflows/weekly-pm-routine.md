# Weekly PM Routine (AI-Native)

## What this is
An operating rhythm for AI-empowered Product Managers. It shifts your time away from writing JIRA tickets towards higher leverage activities: talking to users, shaping context, and evaluating fast prototypes.

## When to use it
Adopt this as your weekly cadence. It optimises for building rapid prototypes mid-week and making kill/ship decisions before the weekend.

---

## Monday: Planning & Context Refresh

*Goal: Ensure the AI agents (and human engineers) are grounded in reality.*

- **Morning (1 hour): Update Context Docs** 
  - Read through support tickets submitted over the weekend. Did users hit edge cases we missed last week?
  - Update `product-context.md` with any new hard constraints (e.g., "Engineering informed us we are migrating to Vercel next week—no new AWS Lambda deployments").
  - Update `user-context.md` if any macro behaviours shifted.
- **Afternoon (1 hour): Problem Shaping**
  - Grab the top 3 priorities for the week.
  - Run the draft ideas through the `clarify-ambiguity.md` prompt.
  - Fill out a tight `problem-statement.md` for each priority. Ensure success metrics are mathematically sound.

## Tuesday & Wednesday: Prototyping & Discovery

*Goal: Generate options, turn ambiguous ideas into tangible software, talk to humans.*

- **Morning: The `Zero-to-Prototype` Sprint**
  - Use 2 hours to rapidly prototype the most uncertain problem using the [Zero to Prototype Workflow](zero-to-prototype.md). Let the agent do the heavy lifting. Push the messy, functional prototype to a branch.
- **Midday (Async): Agent Research**
  - Drop a competitor's docs into Cursor or Claude Code and run the `competitor-analysis.md` prompt.
  - Process last week’s user calls using the `interview-synthesis.md` prompt.
- **Afternoon: Human Feedback**
  - Show the rough prototype you built in the morning to a real user, a stakeholder, or a senior engineer. Do not ask for code review. Ask: "Does this workflow feel correct?"

## Thursday: Evaluation & Polish

*Goal: Turn learning into decisions. Prepare for shipment.*

- **Morning (1 hour): Ruthless Evaluation**
  - Load the `@skills/evaluation.md` skill.
  - Run the `review-output.md` prompt on your prototype or on branch code generated by engineers.
  - Identify the unhandled edge cases. Ask the agent to fix the critical path blockers and ignore cosmetic issues.
- **Afternoon: Spec Writing**
  - If the prototype proves the hypothesis but the code is unscalable garbage (which it often is), run the [Discovery to Spec Workflow](discovery-to-spec.md) to formally hand the robust feature off to engineering. 

## Friday: Decisions & Retrospectives

*Goal: Don't accumulate debt. Clean up the workshop.*

- **Morning: The Ship or Kill Decision**
  - Look at the prototypes built Tuesday/Wednesday.
  - Run the `ship-or-kill.md` prompt.
  - If it’s a Kill, document the failure in `product-context.md` under "Institutional Memory" and delete the branch. Do not leave dead code lying around.
  - If it's a Ship, work through the `launch-checklist.md`.
- **Afternoon (30 min): Retrospective**
  - Fill out the lightweight `retrospective.md` based on what the agent built versus what you actually wanted. Where did your prompts fail? Adjust your context docs accordingly. Be out the door by 4:00 PM.

# Level 2: Your configured AI workspace

A Claude Project is a persistent workspace where you set instructions once and they apply to every conversation automatically. For PM work, this means you stop re-explaining your product, your users, and your constraints at the start of each session. You do a one-time setup, and Claude starts from useful context instead of starting from zero.

## What you'll have at the end

A Claude Project configured to:
- Behave as a PM collaborator with specific skills loaded
- Know your product context, your users, and your constraints without being told each session
- Ask good questions before producing output rather than generating generic responses
- Evaluate its own output against real user needs rather than just technical correctness

## What you'll need

- A Claude account (free tier works, paid tier recommended for longer context)
- A filled-in version of the context doc templates in [/context-docs/](../../context-docs/) - these are short files that describe your users and product so AI can give grounded answers
- Twenty minutes

Follow the step-by-step instructions in [claude-project-guide.md](./claude-project-guide.md)

## Moving to Level 3

Once your Claude Project is set up, you'll notice the quality of your sessions improving significantly. The natural next step is an AI-native editor - a tool that lets you go from a well-formed problem to a working prototype in an afternoon, not just a document. If that sounds useful, head to /first-ide-session/ when you're ready.

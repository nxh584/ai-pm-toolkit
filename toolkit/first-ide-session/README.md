# Level 3: Your first session in an AI editor

An AI-native editor is a tool where you describe a problem and watch a working solution take shape, without needing to write code yourself. If the idea of using a code editor feels intimidating, that's a reasonable reaction. This guide is written for exactly that feeling, and you are not becoming a developer - you are using a developer's tool to build things you could not build before.

## What you'll have at the end

- A working Cursor installation configured with the toolkit IDE settings
- The experience of running one complete session: from problem description to something real to evaluate
- A sense of what this workflow actually feels like and whether it's worth going deeper

## What you'll need

- A computer with internet access
- About an hour
- A real problem you want to prototype or explore - not a hypothetical

Follow the step-by-step instructions in [cursor-first-session.md](./cursor-first-session.md)

## What comes next

Once your first session is done, go to the main [README](../../README.md) and [QUICKSTART](../../QUICKSTART.md). At that point, the full toolkit is accessible to you and you have all the context you need to use it.

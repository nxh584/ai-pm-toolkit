# Problem statement

## What this does
This helps you turn a messy problem into a clear, structured problem statement. By the end, you'll have a copyable draft you can use as a brief for next steps.

## How to use it
Paste the full prompt below into a new chat. The AI will ask follow-up questions one at a time before drafting anything. Review the draft, say what's off, and let it iterate until it feels accurate.

I'm going to help you write a clear problem statement. I'll ask you a few questions first - the more specific you can be, the better the output. What's the problem you're working on? Describe it however it's sitting in your head right now, even if it feels messy.

How to run this conversation:
- Ask follow-up questions one at a time, not as a list.
- Keep each question short and plain-language.
- Wait for my answer before asking the next question.
- Ask these areas across the first 3-4 exchanges: who is affected, how severely, what they do instead today, what's been tried, and what good would look like.
- Do not draft the problem statement until after 3-4 exchanges.

After those exchanges, draft a structured problem statement with these exact sections:
1. Situation
2. Pain
3. Impact
4. Constraint
5. What a good solution would feel like

Then ask exactly:
"Does this capture it? What's off?"

If I give feedback, revise the statement and ask again if it now captures the problem.

When we finalize, deliver the final version in a clearly marked copyable block.

Close with exactly:
"This is ready to use as the brief for your next AI session, or as the opening of a PRD."

# Level 1: Start here, no setup required

Everything in this directory is designed to be copied and pasted directly into Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI chat tool you use. No accounts to create beyond what you already have, no configuration, no technical knowledge needed.

## How to use these prompt cards

1. Find the card that matches what you're trying to do right now (see the list below)
2. Open it, copy the entire contents
3. Paste it into a new conversation with your AI tool of choice and follow the prompts

Each card is designed to work on its own. You do not need to read anything else first.

## Moving to Level 2

Once you've used a few of these cards, you'll start to notice that the context you provide at the start of each conversation makes a big difference to the output. Level 2 is about making that context persistent - setting up a workspace that remembers your product, your users, and how you like to work, so you're not starting from scratch every session. When that sounds useful, head to /claude-project-setup/

# Which level am I?

This toolkit has three levels, each designed for a different starting point. The right level is the one that feels immediately usable today, not the one that feels most ambitious. Start where you can take action right now.

## If this sounds like you: Level 1

**You use ChatGPT or Claude but never in a structured way**

You open a chat window when you need help with something specific. You type what you need, get an answer, and move on. You haven't set up any custom instructions, saved any prompts, or built any kind of repeatable workflow.

Start with the no-code prompt cards. You'll get immediate value in under two minutes with no setup at all. See [/toolkit/no-code/](./no-code/)

## If this sounds like you: Level 2

**You use AI regularly but every session starts from scratch**

You've used AI enough to know it's useful, but every time you open it you're writing prompts from memory or starting fresh. You'd like a more consistent setup but the idea of using a code editor feels like a step too far right now.

Start with the Claude Project setup. One 20-minute setup gives you a configured AI workspace that gets better with every session. See [/toolkit/claude-project-setup/](./claude-project-setup/)

## If this sounds like you: Level 3

**You're curious about AI editors but don't know where to start**

You've heard about Cursor or Claude Code and understand roughly what they do, but you've never opened one and the idea feels intimidating. You're willing to spend an hour getting set up if someone walks you through it without assuming you know anything.

Start with the first IDE session guide. It's written for exactly this moment and requires no prior experience. See [/toolkit/first-ide-session/](./first-ide-session/)

## If this sounds like you: Already using an IDE

**You're already using Cursor, Claude Code, or Windsurf**

You're comfortable in an AI-native editor and want the full toolkit.

You're in the right place. Start with the main README and the QUICKSTART. The ide-setup/ directory has your config files.

Whichever level you start at, the toolkit is designed to grow with you. Each level ends with a specific next step when you're ready for it. There is no pressure to move faster than feels natural.

# AI PM Prompts

This directory contains ready-to-use prompts designed for different stages of the product development lifecycle. They are not meant to replace your thinking, but to structure your collaboration with an AI agent.

## How to Use These Prompts

Each prompt file follows a consistent structure:
1. **When to use this**: The right moment to reach for the prompt.
2. **What to feed it**: The context or inputs the agent needs to succeed.
3. **The Prompt**: The exact text to paste into your agent session.
4. **What to do with the output**: How to evaluate and iterate on the result.
5. **Common failure modes**: What goes wrong and how to fix it.

## Categories

- **[Problem Shaping](problem-shaping/)**: Prompts to clarify ambiguity, define success, and extract constraints. Use these when you have a loose idea but need to define the boundaries before building.
- **[Prototyping](prototyping/)**: Prompts to guide the agent in building first-pass prototypes, parallel approaches, and course corrections. Use these to turn a shaped problem into a testable wedge.
- **[Research](research/)**: Prompts to synthesise interviews, analyse competitors, and extract Jobs-to-be-Done. Use these to process qualitative data rigorously.
- **[Evaluation](evaluation/)**: Prompts to review agent output and make structured ship-or-kill decisions. Use these to ensure what was built actually solved the user problem.
